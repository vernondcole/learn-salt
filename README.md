### OBSOLETE!

This project has been moved to a new home.

It is now owned by a github "organization" rather than me as an individual.

This reduces the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)
of the project below its former value of "one".  One is bad.

Please go to [https://github.com/salt-bevy](https://github.com/salt-bevy)
to see the new home.

The [lessons](https://github.com/salt-bevy/training) have been
separated from the [working code](https://github.com/salt-bevy/salt-bevy)
for more efficient use both as actual applitions and as learning resources.
