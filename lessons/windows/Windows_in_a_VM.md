#### Microsoft Windows ® in a Virtual Machine

The Vagrantfile in this directory specifies a Windows 10 ®
box supplied by Microsoft. It runs a trial version of win10
good for a few months.  

- `cd /projects/learn-salt/lessons/windows`
- Turn on your interactive VirtualBox GUI.
- start the VM using the usual `vagrant up` command line command.

After you see Windows starting in the GUI's `Preview` window,
click on the green right-arrow (➡) icon. You should be
rewarded with a Windows desktop displayed on your screen.
